# Hi there!ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Daniele Pellegrini**, I was born in **1998** and I'm attending the third year degree at the **University of Parma** in **Computer Engineering**. 

My passion through the computer world start when I was a child: every problem I had I tried to figure it out with the help of my hp. This passion continued as I grew up with the help of videogames: seeing how powerful some computer could be and the amount of problems it could be possibile to solve made me looked forward to study it. From that moment my path has been signed, and this path bring me right there.

This is something I always wanted to learn. I attended a course at the university about it, but I've never developed an entire mobile application on my own to be approved and released in the major stores. I'd want to try the right way to do it and develop something useful, at mine and others fingertips.

# Iâ€™m currently working on ðŸ”­ 
I'm currently work on for the internship in [Maps Group S.p.A](https://mapsgroup.it/) and writing my first degree thesis. The project is about a reverse engineering work to refactor a web and mobile software to improve the queue management at the counter in the hospital facilities. More informations will be available soon once the repository will be published.
