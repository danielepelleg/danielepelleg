# Hi there!ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Daniele Pellegrini**, I was born in **1998** and I'm attending the first year degree at the **University of Modena and Reggio Emilia** in **Computer Engineering, Cyber Systems curriculum**. 

My passion through the computer world start when I was a child: every problem I had I tried to figure it out with the help of my hp. This passion continued as I grew up with the help of videogames: seeing how powerful some computer could be and the amount of problems it could be possibile to solve made me looked forward to study it. From that moment my path has been signed, and this path bring me right there.

This is something I always wanted to learn. I attended a course at the university about it, but I've never developed an entire mobile application on my own to be approved and released in the major stores. I'd want to try the right way to do it and develop something useful, at mine and others fingertips.

# First Degree Thesis ðŸ“œ
I did an internship in [Maps Group S.p.A](https://mapsgroup.it/) while writing my first degree thesis. The project was about a reverse engineering work to refactor a web and mobile software to improve the queue management at the counter in the hospital facilities. More informations are available on the [Thesis repository](https://github.com/danielepelleg/Tesi).

# Iâ€™m currently working on ðŸ”­ 
I'm now attending a new University in a different city. The reason I chose to change is because here I can build my education choosing the courses I want to attend the most. in this way my education can be guided by my passions and the curiosity I have at a certain time towards a topic.
