# Hi there!ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Daniele Pellegrini**, I was born in **1998** and I'm attending the third year degree at the **University of Parma** in **Computer Engineering**. My passion through the computer world is born when I was a child: every problem I had I tried to figure it out with the help of my hp. This passion continued as I grew up with the help of videogames: seeing how powerful some computer could be and the amount of problems they could solve made me looked forward to study it. From that moment I think my path has been signed, and this path bring me right there.

# Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸŒ± 
* Mobile Application

This is something I always wanted to learn. I attended a course at the university about it, but I've never developed an entire mobile application on my own to be approved and released in the major stores. I'd want to try the right way to do it and make something useful, for me and the others.

# Iâ€™m currently working on ðŸ”­ 
My next work is a web app written in React which it will be released on the next weeks. I am developing it with a classmate. The application is about money management, more informations will be found on the repo once it will be public and the application hosted to be used by everyone.
